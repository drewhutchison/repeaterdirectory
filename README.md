[CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/)-compatible csv repeater listing for

# Overview

I'm brand new to amateur radio operating but have started programming my 
handheld using CHIRP based on internet-available repeater listings.
I'm revision-tracking that file here should it be of use to anyone else.
